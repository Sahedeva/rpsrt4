Real time Rock Paper Scissors App

This is my revised app to incorporate full realtime capabilities, which proved to be much more difficult than I anticipated. I had to do extensive research into meteor. Learning how to use the Tracker.autorun fxn proved to be invaluable as well as getting a good grasp on how to make database reactive changes in the dom be accessible in the javascript. Also, learning how to reroute with database changes was very difficult to figure out. Once that was done, I made the app a lot more fun by adding sound effects and music. Figuring out a non repeating playlist and having javascript fxn react to tracks ending was challenging. I learned a lot about setTimeout as well. This was a very rewarding project.
