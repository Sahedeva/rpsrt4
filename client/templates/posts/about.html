		<p id="history">This is a game of strategy that is commonly know as Rock-Paper-Scissors. It is a game played with your hands - hand held in fist is rock, hand held flat is paper, and holding the index and middle finges splayed open and to the side is scissors. You and your opponent face each other and keep your hands neutral and say ready, and then you pump your arms up and down three times while counting out load 1 - 2 - 3. Then you display your chosen symbol to your opponent. Rock will crush scissors for a win but it is defeated by paper which covers it. Paper will cover rock but is cut by scissors. Scissors will cut paper but is crushed by rock. Rock versus Rock, Paper versus Paper, and Scissors versus Scissors will all end in a tie. If one opponent is late to choose, he forfeits. In the version presented on this website, you will select an avatar to represent a general and then select the troops' avatars (rock troops are infantry, paper troops are cavalry, and scissors troops are archers). You can also skip picking an avatar and will be given a default female warrior general leading female troops into battle. You then can choose to enter the game lobby and find other players online to challenge to a realtime game of RaShamBo or play against Hal (the computer). Good luck, and may fortune favor the brave.</p>
