		<p id="history">	Since the Han Dynasty(206 BC – 220 AD), warrior generals have honed their battlefield skills in a game that tests every aspect of their strategic and tactical prowess. This was known as shoushiling (<span id='characters'>手势令</span>: 'hand command'), and was imported into Japan becoming sansukumi-ken (<span id='characters'>三竦み拳</span>) - meaning "ken" (<span id='characters'>拳</span>) [fist] game with a three-way [<span id='characters'>三</span>] (san) deadlock [<span id='characters'>竦み</span>] (sukumi). The earliest form was Mushi-ken (<span id='characters'>虫拳</span>: 'frog-fist') - utilizing three symbols: 'thumb' -> the frog representing a cavalry charge, 'little finger' -> the slug representing a defensive formation, and 'index finger' -> the snake representing an encircling flanking maneuver. The most popular one in Japan was kitsune-ken (<span id='characters'>狐拳</span>) where a supernatural fox called a kitsune (<span id='characters'>狐</span>) defeats the village head, the village head (<span id='characters'>庄屋</span>) defeats the hunter, and the hunter (<span id='characters'>猟師</span>) defeats the fox. Another variant was jan-ken which used fist for defense, an open hand for encirclement, and the index and middle fingers in a 'scissor' position for charge. This came to the west as Rock-Paper-Scissors, but is best known as <div id="historyText"></div></p>
